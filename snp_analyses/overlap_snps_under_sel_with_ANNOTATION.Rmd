# This is for table S4!

####
# this script was updated again on aug 20 2019 after removing a small subset of contaminated snps.
# this script was updated on halloween 2018 for the mm80 redo
# script first started on October 11 2018
# updated feb 22 2019 with processed bayescan results
# this script is for merging the snps under selection file to the vcf file and to the annotations file
